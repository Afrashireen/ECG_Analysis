# Real Time ECG Analysis

This project is a real-time ECG (Electrocardiogram) analysis system developed using JavaScript, with a responsive and dynamic front-end built using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to visualize ECG signals in real time and offer an interactive web-based interface for monitoring and basic analysis.

# Project Objective
The goal of this project is to simulate real-time ECG signal monitoring on the web and demonstrate how JavaScript can be used for dynamic data handling and rendering. The user interface is designed to be clean, interactive, and user-friendly, allowing users to view heart signals in a format similar to what they would see on a hospital monitor.

# Technologies Used
JavaScript – For real-time signal rendering and logic implementation

HTML5 – For structuring the web page

CSS3 – For styling and making the interface responsive

# Features

Real-time ECG waveform plotting using JavaScript

Responsive and modern user interface using HTML/CSS

Simulated signal generator or live input integration capability

Clear layout with real-time refresh capability for accurate display

Easy-to-understand visuals suitable for demo or educational use
